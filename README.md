This just runs SMAPI silently without the console, nothing fancy in the slightest. 

**Instructions:**

- Put 'SilentSmapi.exe' in your main Stardew Directory along side Smapi. 
- Set your launch options in steam for Stardew point to the Silent Smapi executable (e.g: **"f:\software\steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\SilentSmapi.exe" %command%**)


**Virus Total Report (possible AV false positives, because it's running an exe hidden):**
